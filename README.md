âœ¨ WELCOME ABOARD! âœ¨
By reading this documentation, youâ€™ll be fully prepared to jump into the project, understand its structure, and maintain it with confidence.
We designed this architecture to be clean, scalable, and fun to work with.

Think of this doc as your quick tour guide ðŸš€ â€” once you go through it, youâ€™ll know exactly where things live, how to name files,
and how to extend features without breaking a sweat.

Letâ€™s build and maintain this project with excellence together ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥

# PROJECT STRUCTURE DOCUMENTATION

This project follows **Clean Architecture** combined with **Atomic Design** for the presentation layer.

## NAMING CONVENTIONS

- Entities -> app_user.dart -> class AppUser
- Models -> app_user_model.dart -> class AppUserModel
- UseCases -> sign_in_usecase.dart -> class SignInUsecase
- Cubit/Bloc -> auth_cubit.dart -> class AuthCubit
- Atomic Design -> button_atom.dart, email_password_form_molecule.dart,
  login_form_organism.dart, auth_scaffold_template.dart, login_page.dart

---

## KEY CONCEPTS

CLEAN ARCHITECTURE

- Domain: business rules, independent of frameworks
- Data: implementation of repositories and datasources
- Presentation: UI + State Management

ATOMIC DESIGN

- Atoms: basic UI elements
- Molecules: simple combination of atoms
- Organisms: complex UI components
- Templates: page structure/layout
- Pages: concrete screens

---

## GLOBAL STATE

AppCubit (shared/presentation/bloc/app_cubit.dart) handles:

- Theme (light/dark)
- Localization (language)
- Global configurations

---

## BENEFITS

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy testing at each layer
- Reusable UI components
- Scalable feature-based structure
- Centralized global state
